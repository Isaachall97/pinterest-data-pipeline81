# Pinterest Data Pipeline

## Introduction

In the digital age, the ability to handle vast amounts of data efficiently and effectively can define the success of a platform. Pinterest, a major player in the social media landscape, processes billions of data points daily to enhance user engagement and deliver value. Inspired by this, this project aims to develop a similar data processing system, utilizing the robust capabilities of the AWS Cloud. This data pipeline emulates key aspects of Pinterest's approach to data management and analytics, focusing on scalability, reliability, and speed.
